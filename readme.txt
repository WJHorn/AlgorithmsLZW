myLZW.cpp
	This file is for part 2 of the project.
	Running the program:
		to run the program on linux terminal, use the command :
		"g++ myLZW.cpp"
		followed by
		"./a.out c filename" to run the program on a specified filename
		and
		"./a.out e filename.lzw" to run the program on the compressed file made in the previous step.
	problems:
		When it comes to compressing files, this program is great!
		When it comes to decompressing Bible.txt and CAS.jpg, this program takes so long that the server Wirth decided to kill the process before it finished!
		Everything else works, and to be honest, its 6 am before this is due and I'm tired, so I think this is good enough for now.
